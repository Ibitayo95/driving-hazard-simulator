public class PlayerRouteWaypoint : MonoBehaviour
    // currently is just needed to be placed on each waypoint so that the route class can gather them and put them into an array for the car to use
    // can be extended to include some specific code for a waypoint

    // example: bool playerAtIntersection = true;
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
