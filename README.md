# VR DRIVING SIMULATOR

Virtual reality (VR) technology has demonstrated that it may be a very valuable and successful training tool for safety simulations. Because of the risk that learner and inexperienced drivers pose to themselves and other road users, it was proposed to create a VR simulation focusing on hazard perception. This project aims to enhance the present 3D testing and training methodologies used for the UK theory driving exam. Unity was used to build a virtual driving environment in which users may practise spotting road dangers and receive feedback on their performance. This is dynamic in nature, with a variety of randomised dangers, day/night cycles, and unpredictable weather patterns. The simulator renders 3D driving scenes using the Unity game engine and incorporates Unity's XR interaction framework for playback across multiple platforms. A variety of evaluations (technology acceptance model, cognitive walkthrough, technical evaluation) revealed that the optimised high-fidelity simulation was simple to use, realistic, immersive, and performant. 
This study provides a solid foundation for using immersive VR technology to improve hazard awareness training, paving the way for future advancements that may eventually improve road safety.
